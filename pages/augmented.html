                <p>With AR books, games, and other teaching materials, students can be immersed in a virtually enhanced world which encourages them to use their imagination and discover the possibilities of the new world, all this while learning new things in a fun and interactive way.
                    Although it’s very important, the fun factor isn’t the only benefit of incorporating AR technology in the learning strategy. If AR is introduced successfully in education it can have incredible results:
                    </p>
                <p>Two of the most admirable traits of humans are their curiosity and imagination. We are curious by nature and we get excited whenever we find something new. We like to ask questions like Why? and What if? and we use our imagination and resources to find answers to our questions. If our ancestors would not have been so curious and imaginative we would still live in caves. But, fortunately for us, they had questions and found many answers, so they got us where we are today. Now it’s our turn to build the future and answer future challenges using these two great assets.
                    The only way to build the future on curiosity and imagination is through an education that is rooted in the same principles. Teaching and learning has to be much more than a simple process of knowledge transfer. Education has to point students in the right direction and show them how to use all their knowledge, coupled with their imagination, to accomplish truly extraordinary things.
                    If teaching methods are built mainly on textbooks and standardized tests, it will be really difficult to teach students to be curious and use their imagination. Reading hundreds of pages and filling out standardized tests won’t jog anyone’s fantasy and creativity. Instead, teachers should try to incorporate new and innovative technologies in their instruction, that demand learners to be inventive and creative while learning and responding to assignments.
                    One such tool that can help students and teachers to get creative is Augmented Reality, or shortly, AR.
