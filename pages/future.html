                <p>The role of classroom education has shifted in recent years. The focus has moved away from memorizing textbooks to learning critical thinking, collaboration and digital literacy. To ensure workforce preparedness, it is not enough to change WHAT we teach at schools. It’s time to consider HOW we teach at schools.</p>
                <p> From the past everything has been changed. In the past, people used to travel by foot. Then they shifted to bullock carts and horse carriages for travel. Now we have the most advanced vehicles like train, bus, plane etc. for travel. Similarly, people used letters to communicate and now we have smartphones. Through that we can communicate from one place to another around the world within a few seconds. But in the case of education, we still follow the primitive system. Education is still the same as it was before. It is still textual like 2000 years ago.</p>
                <p>Since the invention of the printing press in 1440, we did not see any major technology disruption in the education sector for more than 500 years till the last decade.
                    Fortunately, things have started to improve. People start using technology in education sector
                </p>
                <p>We are converting a 2000 years old textual education system into visual education. So that the education system can step into the new era of technology by the help of visual content and AR technology.</p>
                <p>Students will able to memorize and understand his lesson more effectively by this service </p>
                <p>Lets make the technological evolution to Education industry together</p>
